# Masking on payment form

## Things which I have learnt : Masking of Inputs

> An interactive masking project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where users can experience the behavior of masking in the input fields of payment form wherein javaScript is used to handle user interactions and control, providing an engaging and interactive browsing experience."

## In this project, Masking has been implemented on 3 fields: 

> Card Number Masking:

- **Implementation:** The card number field displays with group of 4 masked.

- **User Experience:** This allows users to verify their card number while protecting the full details from potential onlookers.

> Masking on Expiry Date Field:

- **Implementation:** The expiration date field uses a masked format, showing only the month and year in a masked format (e.g., /20). The full date is retained in the backend for processing.

- **User Experience:** Users can easily identify their expiration date without revealing complete details during entry.

> Masking of CVV field:

- **Implementation:** The CVV field is masked entirely during input, displaying asterisks (e.g., ...). Only upon focusing or validating can the CVV be momentarily revealed for confirmation.

- **User Experience:** This ensures that sensitive information is not visible to anyone nearby while maintaining functionality.
